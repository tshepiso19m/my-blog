<h3><big>South Africa: My culture my pride</h3></big>

<img src="image/culture.JPG"
<p class="quote">
Cultural life
Blending Western technology with indigenous technology, Western traditions with African and Asian traditions, South Africa is a study in contrasts. It also provides lessons in how cultures can sometimes blend, sometimes collide; for example, within a short distance of one another can be found the villas of South Africa’s white elite and the tar-paper shacks of Black day labourers, office buildings with the most sophisticated electronic wiring and one-room houses that lack electricity. A great gulf still exists between the white minority and the Black majority in matters of education and economic opportunity. Yet, South Africa is making steady progress in erasing some of these historic disparities and their consequences. Daily life is better for most of its people, and culture and the arts, which sometimes were forced into exile, are flourishing in the free climate of the postapartheid era.

Daily life and social customs
As they are everywhere in the world, patterns of daily life in South Africa are conditioned by social class, ethnicity, religion, and residence: the life of a Black diamond miner in Limpopo province is much different from that of an Indian shopkeeper in Durban, an Afrikaner office worker in Johannesburg, or a teacher of English extraction in Cape Town. As the government struggles to expand the economy in order to provide equally for all citizens, great disparities continue to exist. Yet, all these people are likely to enjoy much the same pleasures: the company of family and friends, films from the studios of Johannesburg and Hollywood alike, music and dance, and visits to South Africa’s magnificent national parks and scenic landscapes.

The great mixture of cultures makes for a wide variety of food choices in the country, from the traditional food of various cultures to the cosmopolitan cuisine that is available in many large cities throughout the world. African food is centred around vegetables, with maize (corn) as an important staple, often in the form of a porridge known as mealie pap. A dish made from broken dried corn kernels, sugar beans, butter, onions, potatoes, chiles, and lemon is called umngqusho. It is still possible to visit a shebeen, an African tavern where beer is home-brewed. Dutch and English settlers introduced sausages and bobotie, a meat pie made with minced meat that has been cooked with brown sugar, apricots and raisins, milk-soaked mashed bread, and curry flavouring. The Portuguese introduced various fish dishes to the country. The Indian influence added spices and even samosas, savoury pastries popular as a snack. All South Africans enjoy the braai, a South African barbeque. Beef, chicken, lamb, pork, ostrich, and other game meat are savoured, although meat consumption is limited in many places because of its expense.

History of South Africa
The prehistory and history of South Africa span nearly the entire known existence of human beings and their ancestors—some three million years or more—and include the wandering of small bands of hominins through the savanna, the inception of herding and farming as ways of life, and the construction of large urban centres. Through this diversity of human experience, several trends can be identified: technological and economic change, shifting systems of belief, and, in the earlier phases of humanity, the interplay between physical evolution and learned behaviour, or culture. Over much of this time frame, South Africa’s past is also that of a far wider area, and only in the last few centuries has this southernmost country of Africa had a history of its own. This article focuses on the country of South Africa. For information about the country in its regional context, see Southern Africa.</p>

Prehistory
The earliest creatures that can be identified as ancestors of modern humans are classified as australopithecines (literally “southern apes”). The first specimen of these hominins to be found (in 1924) was the skull of a child from a quarry site at Taung in what is now the North-West province. Subsequently more australopithecine fossils were discovered in limestone caves farther northeast at Sterkfontein, Swartkrans, and Kromdraai (collectively designated a World Heritage site in 1999), where they had originally been deposited by predators and scavengers.

South Africa’s prehistory has been divided into a series of phases based on broad patterns of technology. The primary distinction is between a reliance on chipped and flaked stone implements (the Stone Age) and the ability to work iron (the Iron Age). Spanning a large proportion of human history, the Stone Age in Southern Africa is further divided into the Early Stone Age, or Paleolithic Period (about 2,500,000–150,000 years ago), the Middle Stone Age, or Mesolithic Period (about 150,000–30,000 years ago), and the Late Stone Age, or Neolithic Period (about 30,000–2,000 years ago). The simple stone tools found with australopithecine fossil bones fall into the earliest part of the Early Stone Age.

The Early Stone Age
Most Early Stone Age sites in South Africa can probably be connected with the hominin species known as Homo erectus. Simply modified stones, hand axes, scraping tools, and other bifacial artifacts had a wide variety of purposes, including butchering animal carcasses, scraping hides, and digging for plant foods. Most South African archaeological sites from this period are the remains of open camps, often by the sides of rivers and lakes, although some are rock shelters, such as Montagu Cave in the Cape region.

<h3><big><b>GENDER BASED VIOLENCE A REAL PROBLEM</big></b>
</h3>

<img src="image/violence.JPG"
<p class="quote">

Gender-based violence, already a global crisis before the pandemic, has intensified since the outbreak of COVID-19. Lockdowns and other mobility restrictions have left many women trapped with their abusers, isolated from social contact and support networks. Increased economic precarity has further limited many women’s ability to leave abusive situations. COVID-driven economic and social instability will also heighten the risk of child marriage, female genital mutilation and human trafficking. At the same time, the pandemic has exposed women leaders to backlash, leading to threats, abuse and harassment both online and offline. Violence against women leaders can prevent them from carrying out their duties regardless of the position they hold.

What can governments do?
Increase resources for shelters, hotlines and other services so that they can meet heightened demand.
Protect elected and non-elected women leaders from gender-based violence. Any efforts to protect and combat violence against women in politics must consider women in all their public roles, including women civil servants and experts.
Consider the communication needs of older women and women with limited access to ICT –– e.g. by setting up emergency warning systems in pharmacies and grocery stores.
Make information and communication channels accessible for women with disabilities.
Scale up public awareness campaigns, particularly those targeted at men and boys.
Develop and implement measures to address online and ICT facilitated violence.
Increase funding to women’s organizations. Evidence shows that the strength of women’s organizations is one of the biggest factors in driving positive EVAW policy changes.
Ensure women’s economic independence by enabling access to and control over regular, secure and long-term income.
What is UN Women doing?
Providing key data on the impacts of COVID-19 on gender-based violence via Rapid Gender Assessment Surveys (RGA) conducted in 13 countries spanning all regions: Albania, Bangladesh, Cameroon, Colombia, Côte d’Ivoire, Jordan, Kenya, Kyrgyzstan, Morocco, Nigeria, Paraguay, Thailand and Ukraine.
Improving access to essential services for survivors, such as shelters and women’s organizations, justice and policing, social services and helplines, including:
Providing funding and resources for shelters and support services in Kosovo, Bolivia, Serbia, Ethiopia, Albania, Columbia, and Viet Nam and across the Pacific and Europe and Central Asia regions;
Supporting and expanding helplines in Malawi, Uganda and Kenya;
Supporting emergency legal assistance services in Nepal and Lebanon, strengthening justice institutions in the West Bank and providing gender-sensitive training for law enforcement personnel in the Arab States region.
In partnership with tech companies like Google and Facebook, providing life-saving information to survivors of domestic violence.
Driving efforts to prevent violence against women in politics, including the passage of 28 measures across 20 countries.

<h4><big>AMAZON-BRAZIL:Facts about PIRAHNAS </h4></big>


<p class="quote">

After sharks, piranhas are one of the world’s most misunderstood fish. They're found in freshwater rivers, ponds, and streams throughout northern South America, and they have a reputation for ferocity—even malice. In Hollywood, they’re often depicted as ravenous pack-hunters who won’t hesitate to eat their way through Bond villains and beach-going teenagers. But in reality, the fish usually try to avoid humans out in the wild. Here are 10 piranha facts that may surprise you.

 <div>1.Piranha attacks on humans are seldom fatal.</div>
<img src="image/pirara1.JPG"

Bites usually happen out of the water: Captured piranhas may chomp on fishermen who try to extricate them from hooks and nets. For the most part, free-swimming piranhas in their natural habitat avoid people, though they may target human swimmers when water levels are low and food is scarce. This probably explains a 2017 incident in which 70 river-bathers were attacked by piranhas in Rosario, Argentina. (Everyone survived.)

Other attacks happen in places where food scraps have been dumped into the water. Male piranhas have also been known to lash out while guarding their eggs. Usually, the human victim is bitten only once and lives, though scientists think the fish aren’t above scavenging human corpses.

<div>2. Schools of piranhas aren't trying to gang up on their victims.</div>
Research suggests traveling in schools is a defensive strategy against predators like cormorants, caimans, and river dolphins. In a 2005 study, cormorant models were shown to groups of captive red-bellied piranhas. The fish who swam alone or in small clusters had faster breathing rates—a clear symptom of stress. By gathering in larger numbers, individual piranhas lower their odds of getting eaten.

<div>3. Most piranhas are omnivores.</div>

Even well-known meat-eating species like the red-bellied and black piranhas can’t resist the occasional fruit, leaf, or fig. Other species eat mainly nuts and seeds. These fish remove the tough outer shells with their teeth before devouring the contents.

<div>4. A few piranhas specialize in eating scales.</div>
<img src="image/pirara2.JPG"
The scales and fins of many fish are 34 to 85 percent protein, but what’s more important is the fact that they’ll often grow back. In other words, they're a renewable food source: A piranha can repeatedly pluck scales off the same victim for years without killing it. The wimple piranha has turned the scale-grazing strategy into an art form. After it sneaks up on a target, it opens its jaws at a 120-degree angle and rips scales off the other animal’s sides. Though the wimple spends its entire life eating scales, some other piranhas will only feed on them as juveniles.

<div>5. Proportionately, the black piranha has the strongest bite of any bony fish.
Native to the upper half of South America, the black piranha measures 8 to 15 inches long. A 2012 study found it can slam its muscular jaws with a bite force of 320 Newtons, three times stronger than an American alligator’s. Relative to its body size, the black piranha’s bite is more powerful than that of any other bony fish.

<div>6. Some fish have piranha-proof armor.</div>

South American arapaima can grow to be 10 feet long and weigh over 400 pounds. The slow-moving fish have little to fear from the piranhas who share their habitats. Arapaima scales are ultra-hard on the outside, but there’s a layer of flexible, cross-hatched fibers on the inside. When the scales get bent, they don’t crack, and lab experiments suggest that the inner fibers safely diffuse the force of a piranha bite.

<div>.7. Piranha teeth are replaceable.</div>
<img src="image/pirara.JPG"
Piranha teeth measure up to 4 millimeters long. The upper and lower teeth interlock, allowing the piranha to slice through vegetation, meat, bone, and even metal. For that reason, piranhas shed the teeth on one side of their head—both lower and upper jaws—at once. A 2019 study in Evolution and Development found that piranhas grow a new set of teeth in their jaws and then swap out the old teeth for the new set several times during their lives.

<div>8. Theodore Roosevelt contributed to piranhas' scary reputation.</div>
During his travels in the Amazon, TR heard tales of the piranha's vicious nature and recounted them in his book Through the Brazilian Wilderness. “They are the most ferocious fish in the world,” Roosevelt wrote. "They will snap a finger off a hand incautiously trailed in the water; they mutilate swimmers ... they will rend and devour alive any wounded man or beast; for blood in the water excites them to madness." His descriptions, which echoed earlier accounts, convinced the American public that piranhas are wildly aggressive, man-eating river monsters. But as scientists now know, this characterization is false.


<div>9. Steven Spielberg called Piranha (1978) “The Best of the Jaws Ripoffs.”</div>
From Orca: The Killer Whale to Tentacles and Barracuda, a veritable school of aquatic horror movies tried to capitalize on Jaws’s success in the late 1970s. Piranha, a cult classic directed by Joe Dante, rode the wave of this trend. Some biologists have accused the flick—and its gory 2010 remake, Piranha 3-D—of contributing to the public’s negative perception of real piranhas.

<div>10. Red-bellied piranhas have shown up in a few U.S. states.</div>
Despite their bloodthirsty reputation, piranhas are a popular aquarium species. Unfortunately, some hobbyists dump them into waterways when they tire of them. They've been reported in 14 states, including Louisiana in 2021. There’s no evidence that red-bellied piranhas are establishing themselves as an invasive species. But if you're wading in a warm river or pond, you'd better watch your ankles.
